## Content

Like the technical community as a whole, the Santander Group Development Teams
community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over
the world.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to. This code applies equally to all.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by contacting the organization owners. If an organization owner is the
person whos violating the code, please contact another organization owner. There
should be at least three of them.

* __Be friendly__ and patient.
* __Be welcoming__. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
  members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration
  status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
  religion, and mental and physical ability.
* __Be considerate__. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be
  communicating in someone else's primary language.
* __Be respectful__. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Santander
  Group Develpoment Community should be respectful when dealing with other
  members as well as with people outside the community.
* __Be careful in the words that you choose__. We are a community of
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
  Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other
  exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
    then stop.
* __When we disagree, try to understand why__. Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time and this project is no exception. It is
  important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
  Remember that we’re different. Different people have different perspectives on
  issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
  that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each
  other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and
  learning from mistakes.

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. To do that,
contact organization owner. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

* __Community Impact__: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
  unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

* __Consequence__: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
  clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
  behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

* __Community Impact__: A violation through a single incident or series of
  actions.

* __Consequence__: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
  interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
  those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time (7 days).
  This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces. Violating these terms
  may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. If the user belong to any team, with
  this level no action should be performed in terms of removing the user from
  that group. The user must accept the consequences and be responsible to
  accomplish them.

### 3. Temporary Ban

* __Community Impact__: A serious violation of community standards, including
  sustained inappropriate behavior.

* __Consequence__: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
  communication with the community for a specified period of time (30 days). No
  public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
  interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this
  period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. If the user belong
  to any team, the user should be removed from the team and revoque privileges
  in the team.

### 4. Permanent Ban

* __Community Impact__: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
  standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
  individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

* __Consequence__: A permanent ban.
