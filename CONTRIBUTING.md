### Your First Code Contribution

#### Local development

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain project's quality
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Engage the community in working toward their best
* Enable a sustainable system for this project's maintainers to review
  contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in
   [the pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all
  [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/)
  are passing. If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure
  is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request
  explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run
  the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false
  positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status
  check suite.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull
request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design
work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately
accepted.
